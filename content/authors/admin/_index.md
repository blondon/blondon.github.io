I am a Sr. Scientist at Amazon Music.
Broadly speaking, I research machine learning theory and algorithms, using theoretical analysis to inform the design of new ML algorithms.

I earned my Ph.D. in 2015 at University of Maryland, where I was advised by Lise Getoor and worked closely with Ben Taskar and Bert Huang.
My dissertation studied generalization in structured learning, and its relationship to the algorithmic stability of collective inference.
I have also worked on: generalization guarantees for randomized learning (such as stochastic gradient methods); recommendation/personalization systems; contextual multi-armed bandits; and counterfactual learning from logged bandit feedback.

Ben London is a Sr. Scientist at Amazon Music, where he is a member of the Music ML team.
Prior to that, he worked for Amazon.com's Core ML team. 
He earned his Ph.D. in 2015 at the University of Maryland, where he was advised by Lise Getoor and worked closely with Ben Taskar and Bert Huang.
His research investigates machine learning theory and algorithms, with a focus on generalization guarantees, structured prediction, recommendation, and learning from logged user interactions.
His work has been published in JMLR, ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS and UAI.
He is a co-organizer of the NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on ML with Guarantees, an area chair for ICML 2020, a senior PC member for IJCAI 2020, and has reviewed for numerous conferences and journals.
